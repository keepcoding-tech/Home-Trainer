# Home Trainer

  - Home Trainer is a mobile application (currently available only for android) where you can build well-structured sports programs. 
  - The main idea is that based on selected activities you can build complex and customized sports programs that you can add to your weekly schedule.
  - Each category of sport has different characteristics, for example, "GYM" will have characteristics such as muscle group, exercise, sets, repetitions, etc; and activity as "RUNNING" will have characteristics such as distance, intensity, break time, etc.
  - After building a sports program, you are now able to schedule it for your weekly routines.
  - You can also benefit from other services such as a stopwatch, timer, or most importantly a graph that analyzes and displays the evolution of the user's physical condition.
  - The app is still in development, so more features are coming soon.
